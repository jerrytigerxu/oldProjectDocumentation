### Getting emails directly into inbox (and not in spam)

### Authentication of the website domain for sending out emails
- ISSUE: the domain `christianstudentsoncampus.com` is not yet authenticated and thus many email service providers view emails from this domain as spam or junk
- You are seeking to authenticate the custom domain (contact@christianstudentsoncampus.com)
- Solutions:
	- The way to authenticate the domain is to update the domain DNS records, which is contained in the web hosting platform (this is necessary when using an email marketing service like Mailchimp)
		- https://mailchimp.com/help/set-up-email-domain-authentication/?utm_source=mc-kb&utm_medium=kb-site&utm_campaign=eepurl
	- Domains from free email providers like gmail.com can't be added to verified domains
	- Potential solution is to simply change the from address:
		- Add "@send.mailchimpapp.com" to the end of the address
		- Example: thepottedplanter@yahoo.com -> thepottedplanter.yahoo.com@send.mailchimpapp.com

### Mailchimp security 
- You can use two-step verification and double opt-in to verify email addresses and target engaged people
	- Double opt-in in the form of verification email
	- Two-step verification in the form of SMS code to confirm identify through phone number (and potentially save phone numbers)
	- *Double opt-in might be sufficient for the purpose of weeding out invalid emails and finding the engaged people*
- **Double opt-in**
	- https://mailchimp.com/help/about-double-opt-in/
	- You can change your opt-in settings through Audiences -> Manage Audience -> Settings -> Audience Name and Defaults -> Form Settings ("enable double opt-in" and "enable reCAPTCHA")
	- For multiple audiences, you can make changes globally on the Opt-in settings page -> "View Audiences" under tab
	- Customizing the opt-in process
		- "You can customize your double opt-in process in the Forms and response emails section of Mailchimp's Form Builder"
