# Projects for January-February 2022

- **Doing data analysis regarding high school seniors potentially going to UT Austin - figuring out how to reach out to them very early -> the goal is to find good candidates for contacting by DMs**
	- Using Airtable (R&D - High School Team)
	- Scraping Instagram and Facebook
	- Phantom Buster for web automation
	- Objective: compiling lists of HS students who are reachable and contactable through Instagram DMs (with the view that there would be an entrance into high schools)
		- Scraping Instagram accounts for bios after scraping influential Instagram accounts for UT schools 
		- Austin outreach service group information: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r9tPnNpZGRCtxT67lQsfY7EH7s-edyHfe5w-P_xR62w/edit
- **Working with Reese Walling on Mailchimp - creating an email newsletter to reach out to UT alumni (those who signed up for the club with email addresses in the past)**
