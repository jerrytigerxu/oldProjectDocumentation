## Search Bar Optimization (SBO)
**Objective**
- What we need
  - Search results should only contain pages and posts, and the results should be relevant and accessible
- Most important components
  - Speed and relevance
  - Flexibility and customization (filtering results and searching within specific content types)
  - Intuitive user interface (including AJAX live search)
  - Intelligent search features
  - Multilingual support and accessibility

**Development Procedure**
- Experiment with code changes on the “experimental branch” and save your actual code changes in this Trello board
- Test pushing your changes (just the php or js files) to the “dev branch” after resetting the experimental branch to match the dev branch
- Only when everyone is satisfied with the results should you update the production site
